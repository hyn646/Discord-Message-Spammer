# Discord-Message-Spammer
Welcome! This is my first Python application that Iâ€™ve published publicly.

HOW TO USE:

Place your auth token in authorization.txt.
Put the Request URL from the Discord channel in channel.txt.
Enter the message you want to spam in content.txt.
Specify the number of times you want your message to be repeated in count.txt.
Enjoy!
